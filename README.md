# Mean Value Calculation in MATLAB

This MATLAB function computes the mean (average) of all elements in a numeric matrix. It manually sums the matrix elements and divides by the total number of elements, without using built-in MATLAB functions like `mean`.

## Features

- Explicit iteration through matrix elements
- Demonstrates fundamental statistical computation
- Useful for learning basic MATLAB programming and data handling

## Usage

Call the function with the matrix and its dimensions:

```matlab
mv = my_meanvalue(a, rows, cols);
